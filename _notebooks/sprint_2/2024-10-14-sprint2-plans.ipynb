    "### Organized Acomplishments\n",
    "- I am becoming well prepared for the College Board (AP) Exam and Project Based Learning now that I have learned or reviewed the fundamentals. Listening through lessons, participating in the popcorn hacks, completing the homework, creating a lesson, and grading homework were all ways that exposed me to the Big Ideas multiple times. I think I gained a good understanding of Big Idea 3 since I had to look back at each lesson multiple times, which refreshed and strengthened my memory everytime I had to look back at it. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlight of Lesson\n",
    "- I think a highlight of my presentation/contribution to my team was the use of flowcharts in the lesson. I created the flowcharts for all the lessons under my team. Using flowcharts to teach conditions was helpful because it showed how each line related to each other. I noticed that my peers remembered our lesson from the flowcharts since it was unique and it was also one of the first standout things seen as it was at the top of each 3.6 and 3.7 lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "### My Learning\n",
    "- Something impactful I learned from another lesson were the different naming conventions that I now can identify and choose to use in my own code. In that same lesson (3.1), learned about dictionaries, which I was familiar with but didn't know the name of it. Now I can put a name to the code. I also learned a lot in 3.4, where I learned many ways to manipulate strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Personal Growth/Acomplishment\n",
    "- For my own personal growth, I think that I improved in my understanding of code overall. I was familiar with Mort's style of class/coding since I did take CSSE last year. Last year, we worked on creating games with the exact ideas within Big Idea 3. The knowledge I lacked last year was the actual meaning and use of those ideas. Before I was able to create code based off of example code given, but now I can say that I am more confident in attempting to write my own original code. "
