    "An educational web game that introduces DNA base pairing through interactive, fast-paced challenges. Players must correctly pair DNA bases before the sequence disappears, while concept-reinforcing trivia that is integrated with Google Gemini, which helps deepen understanding of basic biology after errors. High scores are stored with the High Score API and displayed on the leaderboard to encourage users to beat their high score, increasing their practice with DNA Dynamite. \n",
