    "- In Friends, the lack of diversity in the show has been criticized for not being diverse. Most characters are white, and people of color have very small roles, which makes the show unrepresentative. This bias most likely came from the entertainment industry's preference for casting mostly white actors at the time.\n",

    "- When I try to open google docs, sheets, etc on my phone through my browser, the sizing doesn't convert properly. It would force me to download their app for better user experience. It was annoying and I realized I'd have to de extra work to just look at a doc on my phone. The technology could be improved by making sure the screen sizing works on any size device. \n",
