    "For my group's social media, we attempted to create a social media page inspired by the social media BeReal where you can post a picture at randomized times and share it with your friends on the page. This involved a lot of styling and backend, especially in creating a lot of code from scratch. Our biggest challenge was making a persons image be able to be posted and connect to their profile. Overall our idea was good, but as we learned and as we heard from our peers, our idea was very complicated for a project that was not supposed to be going on for a long time. I suspect that if we continued to work on our project for longer, we would have been able to perfect it. "

It's been one of my goals to work on upon the beginning of CSP, since I was in CSSE and was able to code with examples given to me. In this sprint, I did actually start to understand creating variables for divs and creating a container for our page with the help of my teammates. "
