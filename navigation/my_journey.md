# Journey of Setting Up for APCSP, Trimester 1
## Tools Setup
Since I took CSSE during the 2023-2024 school year, I had most of the tools that were required to be set up. 
- **Updating Packages:**
After following directions from the "Tools Setup" from Nighthawk Pages, I still read through the page, where I saw that I updated my Ubuntu. After verifying tools later on in the page, I also made sure to have Jupyter and Python.
- **Finish of Tools Setup:**
Other than updating the packages, following the directions from the page was pretty standard and simple.

## Personal Page
Following the directions to create our own repository was pretty standard and I also was pretty familiar with the steps. Now, I have my own page and I am continuously working on customizing it. 
- **Changes Made to Page:** 
I've made sure the makefile and config.yml match the information from my repo and git user, and I also have started my about me page. I'm currently working on changing some colors and possibly which theme the page is under.
