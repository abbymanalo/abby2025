# Safe Computing

## Personal Data
Personal data refers to information related to an individual that can be used to identify them.

## PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
Examples include:
- Age  
- Gender  
- Location  

## Risks of Collecting Personal Data
- Unauthorized access  
- Data breaches  
- Misuse of data  
- Loss of privacy  
- Phishing attacks  
- Identity theft  

## Prevention
- Encrypt: Secure data by encrypting stored and transmitted information  
- Strong Authentication: Use multi-factor authentication  
- Regularly Update Security: Keep security systems up to date  
- Access Control: Limit access to sensitive data  
- Unique Passwords: Use different passwords for all accounts  

## Authentication Measures
- Multi-Factor Authentication: Requires users to verify identity using multiple authentication factors (e.g., enter a password and then get a verification code via text)  
- Strong Passwords: Use at least 8-16 characters, different characters and numbers, and different passwords for all accounts  
- Multi-Factor Authentication and Security Layers: Requires multiple pieces of evidence to verify identity  

## Encryption
Encodes data to prevent unauthorized access, while decryption restores it to a readable format.

## Certificate Authorities
Trusted entities that issue digital certificates to verify the authenticity of websites and enable secure encrypted communications.

## Antivirus and Malware Protection
Prevents and removes malicious programs for safe computing systems.
- Signature-based detection, heuristic analysis, and real-time monitoring to identify threats  
- Blocks suspicious activities and infected files  

## Privacy and Permissions
You should control permissions that applications have to protect your privacy.
- Review permission settings for apps  
- Manage cookies  

## Phishing
A technique that attempts to trick a user into providing personal information. That personal information can then be used to access sensitive online resources, such as bank accounts and email.
- Prevention: Don't click on links from people you don't know or trust  

## Keylogging
The use of a program to record every keystroke made by a computer user in order to gain fraudulent access to passwords and other confidential information.
- Prevention: Don't install untrusted software or apps  

## Data Interception
Data sent over public networks can be intercepted, analyzed, and modified. One way this can happen is through a rogue access point.
- Prevention: Connect to secure networks and verify the address of websites you connect to are legitimate  

## Rogue Access Point
A wireless access point that gives unauthorized access to secure networks (fake Wi-Fi or fake website).
- Prevention: Connect to trusted networks and only send information via websites with HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) to ensure data is encrypted  

## Malicious Links
Can be disguised on a web page or in an email message.
- Prevention: Don't click links that you don't know  

## Malicious Emails
Unsolicited emails, attachments, links, and forms in emails can be used to compromise the security of a computing system. These can come from unknown senders or from known senders whose security has been compromised.
- Prevention: Don't download files or click random links from emails. If you have to, make sure it's someone you know and can verify if it was actually them  

## Freeware
Often free downloads from freeware or shareware sites can contain malware.
- Prevention: Don't download software for free, especially if there is a popular paid version. If you have to, make sure it's from a trusted site that you know and can verify has no malware
