# Computer Bias

## What Is Computer Bias?
- Unfair preferences built into a computer system  
- Data issues (missing data about certain people or situations)  
- Design choices where developers assume everyone uses the product the same way  
- Testing groups may miss feedback from the broader population  
- Humans are behind every tech tool, and our biases can show up unintentionally  

## Everyday Examples of Bias
- Netflix recommendations: leans on past choices, tends to show the same genres repeatedly  
- Virtual assistants: defaults like Siri or Alexa often use female voices, reinforcing stereotypes of women as helpers or assistants  
- Social media platforms: apps like Facebook and TikTok favor different demographics through design, marketing, and trends  

## Case Study: HP Camera Bias
- HP camera couldn't track faces with darker skin tones  
- Issue occurred because testing was only done with people of lighter skin tones  

## Avoiding Bias in Technology
- Expand and diversify datasets  
- Encourage diverse development teams  
- Thorough testing with a wide range of users  
- Document design assumptions clearly  

## Why It Matters
- Reducing bias can help create a more inclusive and fair world
