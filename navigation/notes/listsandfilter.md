# Lists and Filtering Algorithms

## What Are Lists in Python?
- A list is just an ordered collection of stuff like numbers, words, or even True/False values.
- Lists are **mutable**, meaning you can change them after creating them.
- Lists are written in square brackets `[]`.

## Creating Lists
- You can throw a bunch of different types of things into one list, like a mix of numbers, text, or booleans.

## Accessing List Items
- You can grab items from a list by using **positive indexing** (starting from 0) or **negative indexing** (starting from -1, counting from the end).

## Changing Lists
- You can update things in a list, add new stuff, or remove things you don't need anymore.

## What Are Filtering Algorithms?
- Filtering algorithms help you make a new list by picking out things that meet certain conditions.
- Example: you could filter a list to just show even numbers or people older than a certain age.

## Efficiency of Filtering
- Filtering means going through each item in the list one by one.
- The bigger the list, the longer it takes to filter through.
- This is called **O(n) time complexity**, which basically means the time it takes grows with the list size.
