My name is Abby. I'm a junior at Del Norte Highschool. I'm sixteen and my birthday is on January 1st. In my free time, I like to hangout with my friends. We like to go shopping, go to the beach, or go to each others houses. I'm the youngest daughter in a family of four. I do dance, mainly ballet, jazz, and contemporary. I'm in APCSP so that I can continue on the school's CTE pathway and hopefully work in computer science and program management in the future.
