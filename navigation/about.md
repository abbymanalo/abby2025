<div style= "font-size: 150%">
My name is Abby. I'm a junior at Del Norte Highschool. I'm sixteen and my birthday is on January 1st. I was born in Signapore but then moved to San Diego when I was five years old. 
In my free time, I like to hangout with my friends. We like to go shopping, go to the beach, or go to each others houses. I'm the youngest daughter in a family of four. 
I do dance, mainly ballet, jazz, and contemporary. Though I don't intend on training to become a professional dancer, I do train sixteen hours a week at the dance studio I attend. 
I'm in APCSP so that I can continue on the school's CTE pathway and hopefully work in computer science and program management in the future.

## Places I've Lived

I am full Filipino, and I had a Filipino citizenship until my family and I got our American citizenship about a year ago!

I was born in Singapore and I lived there until I was five years old before moving to San Diego. I haven't visited Singapore in a few years, but the next time I travel I hope to go there!
